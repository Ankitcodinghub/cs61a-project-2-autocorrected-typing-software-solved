Logistics

The project is worth 20 points. 19 points are assigned for correctness of your �nal code, and 1 point for submitting Phase 1 by the checkpoint deadline.

You will turn in the following �les: • cats.py

You do not need to modify or turn in any other �les to complete the project. To submit the project, run the following command:

<pre> python3 ok --submit
</pre>
You will be able to view your submissions on the Ok dashboard (http://ok.cs61a.org). For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some initial code that we

provide. If you would rather not use that code, feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new function de�nitions as you see �t.

However, please do not modify any other functions. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of arguments).

Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code. It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems. However, you should not be testing too often, to allow yourself time to think through problems.

We have provided an autograder called ok to help you with testing your code and tracking your progress. The �rst time you run the autograder, you will be asked to log in with your Ok account using your web browser. Please do so. Each time you run ok , it will back up your work and progress on our servers.

The primary purpose of ok is to test your implementations.

We recommend that you submit after you �nish each problem. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission.

If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about your progress, you can run

<pre> python3 ok --local
</pre>
With this option, no information will be sent to our course servers. If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre>  python3 ok -q [question number] -i
</pre>
with the appropriate question number (e.g. 01 ) inserted. This will run the tests for that question until the �rst one you failed, then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.

You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre>  print("DEBUG:", x)
</pre>
which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail with extra output.

Problem 1 (1 pt)

Implement choose . This function selects which paragraph the user will type. It takes three parameters: a list of paragraphs (strings); a select function, which returns True for paragraphs that can be selected; and a non-negative index k . The choose function return’s the k th paragraph for which select returns True . If no such paragraph exists (because k is too large), then choose returns the empty string.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.

Problem 2 (2 pts)

Implement about , which takes a list of topic words. It returns a function which takes a paragraph and returns a boolean indicating whether that paragraph contains any of the words in topic .

Once we’ve implemented about , we’ll be able to pass the returned function to choose as the select argument, which will be useful as we continue to implement our typing test.

To be able to make this comparison accurately, you will need to ignore case (that is, assume that uppercase and lowercase letters don’t change what word it is) and punctuation in the paragraph. Additionally, only check for exact matches of the words in topic in the paragraph, not substrings. For example, “dogs” is not a match for the word “dog”.

Hint: You may use the string utility functions in utils.py .

Problem 3 (2 pts)

Implement accuracy , which takes a typed paragraph and a reference paragraph. It returns the percentage of words in typed that exactly match the corresponding words in reference . Case and punctuation must match as well. “Corresponding” here means that two words must occur at the same indices in typed and reference —the �rst words of both must match, the second words of both must match, and so on.

A word in this context is any sequence of characters separated from other words by whitespace, so treat “dog;” as all one word.

If typed is longer than reference , then the extra words in typed that have no corresponding word in reference are all incorrect.

If both typed and reference are empty, then the accuracy is 100.0. If typed is empty but reference is not empty, then the accuracy is zero. If typed is not empty but

reference is empty, then the accuracy is zero.

Problem 4 (1 pt)

Implement wpm , which computes the words per minute, a measure of typing speed, given a string typed and the amount of elapsed time in seconds. Despite its name, words per minute is not based on the number of words typed, but instead the number of groups of 5 characters, so that a typing test is not biased by the length of words. The formula for words per minute is the ratio of the number of characters (including spaces) typed divided by 5 (a typical word length) to the elapsed time in minutes.

For example, the string “I am glad!” contains three words and ten characters (not including the quotation marks). The words per minute calculation uses 2 as the

Time to test your typing speed! You can use the command line to test your typing speed on paragraphs about a particular topic. For example, the command below will load paragraphs about cats or kittens. See the run_typing_test function for the implementation if you’re curious (but it is de�ned for you).

You can try out the web-based graphical user interface (GUI) using the following command. (You may have to use Ctrl+C or Cmd+C on your terminal to quit the GUI after you close the tab in your browser).

To submit your Phase 1 checkpoint type: python3 ok –submit

You can submit again once you’ve �nished the whole project, and we will score only your latest submission, but please submit at least once before the checkpoint deadline (after �nishing at least the Phase 1 questions) to receive credit for the checkpoint.

Phase 2: Autocorrect

In the web-based GUI, there is an autocorrect button, but right now it doesn’t do anything. Let’s implement automatic correction of typos. Whenever the user presses the space bar, if the last word they typed doesn’t match a word in the dictionary but is close to one, then that similar word will be substituted for what they typed.

Hint Video

Problem 5 (2 pts)

Implement autocorrect , which takes a typed_word , a list of all valid_words , a diff_function , and a limit .

If the typed_word is contained inside the valid_words list, autocorrect returns that word.

Otherwise, autocorrect returns the word from valid_words that has the lowest di�erence from the provided typed_word based on the diff_function . However, if the lowest di�erence between typed_word and any of the valid_words is greater than

limit , then typed_word is returned instead.

A di� function takes in three arguments. The �rst two arguments are the two strings to be compared (the typed_word and a word from valid_words ), and the third argument is the limit . The output of the di� function, which is a number, represents the amount of di�erence between the two strings.

Here is an example of a di� function that computes the minimum of 1 + limit and the di�erence in length between the two input strings:

&gt;&gt;&gt; def length_diff(w1, w2, limit):

… return min(limit + 1, abs(len(w2) – len(w1))) &gt;&gt;&gt; length_diff(‘mellow’, ‘cello’, 10)

1

&gt;&gt;&gt; length_diff(‘hippo’, ‘hippopotamus’, 5)

6

Assume that typed_word and all elements of valid_words are lowercase and have no punctuation.

Important: if multiple strings have the same lowest di�erence according to the diff_function , autocorrect should return the string that appears �rst in valid_words .

Problem 6 (2 pts)

Implement feline_flips , which is a di� function that takes two strings. It returns the minimum number of characters that must be changed in the start word in order to transform it into the goal word. If the strings are not of equal length, the di�erence in lengths is added to the total.

Important: You may not use while or for statements in your implementation. Use recursion.

Here are some examples:

<pre> &gt;&gt;&gt; big_limit = 10
 &gt;&gt;&gt; feline_flips("nice", "rice", big_limit)    # Substitute: n -&gt; r
 1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; feline_flips("range", "rungs", big_limit)  # Substitute: a -&gt; u, e -&gt; s
 2
 &gt;&gt;&gt; feline_flips("pill", "pillage", big_limit) # Don't substitute anything, length diffe
 3
 &gt;&gt;&gt; feline_flips("roses", "arose", big_limit)  # Substitute: r -&gt; a, o -&gt; r, s -&gt; o, e -
 5
 &gt;&gt;&gt; feline_flips("rose", "hello", big_limit)   # Substitute: r-&gt;h, o-&gt;e, s-&gt;l, e-&gt;l, len
 5
</pre>
If the number of characters that must change is greater than limit , then feline_flips should return any number larger than limit and should minimize the amount of computation needed to do so.

These two calls to feline_flips should take about the same amount of time to evaluate:

Implement minimum_mewtations , which is a di� function that returns the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform the start word into the goal word.

There are three kinds of edit operations:

���Add a letter to start ,

���Remove a letter from start , ���Substitute a letter in start for another.

Each edit operation contributes 1 to the di�erence between two words.

(Optional) Extension: �nal diff (0pt)

You may optionally design your own di� function called final_diff . Here are some

ideas for making even more accurate corrections:

<ul>
<li>Take into account which additions and deletions are more likely than others. For example, it’s much more likely that you’ll accidentally leave out a letter if it appears twice in a row.</li>
<li>Treat two adjacent letters that have swapped positions as one change, not two.</li>
<li>Try to incorporate common misspellings
You can also set the limit you’d like your di� function to use by changing the value of the variable FINAL_DIFF_LIMIT in cats.py .

If you don’t know where to start, try copy-pasting your code for feline_flips and minimum_mewtations into final_diff and scoring them. Looking at the typos they

accidentally �xed might give you some ideas!

Phase 3: Multiplayer

Typing is more fun with friends! You’ll now implement multiplayer functionality, so that when you run gui.py on your computer, it connects to the course server at cats.cs61a.org (https://cats.cs61a.org) and looks for someone else to race against.

To race against a friend, 5 di�erent programs will be running:

<ul>
<li>Your GUI, which is a program that handles all the text coloring and display in your web browser.</li>
<li>Your gui.py , which is a web server that communicates with your GUI using the code you wrote in cats.py .</li>
<li>Your opponent’s gui.py .</li>
<li>Your opponent’s GUI.</li>
<li>The CS 61A multiplayer server, which matches players together and passes
messages around.

When you type, your GUI sends what you have typed to your gui.py server, which computes how much progress you have made and returns a progress update. It also sends a progress update to the multiplayer server, so that your opponent’s GUI can display it.

Meanwhile, your GUI display is always trying to keep current by asking for progress updates from gui.py , which in turn requests that info from the multiplayer server.

Each player has an id number that is used by the server to track typing progress. Hint Video

Problem 8 (2 pts)

Implement report_progress , which is called every time the user �nishes typing a word. It takes a list of the words sofar , a list of the words in the prompt , the user’s user_id , and a send function that is used to send a progress report to the multiplayer server. There will never be more words in sofar than in prompt .

Your progress is a ratio of the words in the prompt that you have typed correctly, up to the �rst incorrect word, divided by the number of prompt words. For example, this example has a progress of 0.25 :

<pre> report_progress(["Hello", "ths", "is"], ["Hello", "this", "is", "wrong"], ...)
</pre>
Your report_progress function should do two things: send a message to the multiplayer server and return the progress of the player with user_id .
</li>
</ul>

You can send a message to the multiplayer server by calling the send function on a two-element dictionary containing the keys ‘id’ and ‘progress’ . You should then return the player’s progress, which is the ratio of words you computed.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

<pre> python3 ok -q 08

Problem 9 (2 pts)

Implement time_per_word , which takes in times_per_player , a list of lists for each player with timestamps indicating when each player �nished typing each word. It also takes in a list words . It returns a game with the given information.

A game is a data abstraction that has a list of words and times . The times are stored as a list of lists of how long it took each player to type each word. times[i][j] indicates how long it took player i to type word j .

Timestamps are cumulative and always increasing, while the values in times are di�erences between consecutive timestamps for each player.

Be sure to use the game constructor when returning a game , rather than assuming a particular data format. Read the de�nitions for the game constructor and selectors in

cats.py to learn more about how the data abstraction is implemented.

Hint: See the dictionary below for an example of a potential input into the send function. This dictionary represents a player with user_id 1 and progress 0.6.

<pre> {'id': 1, 'progress': 0.6}

<div class="column">
Here’s an example: If times_per_player = [[1, 3, 5], [2, 5, 6]] , the corresponding times attribute of the game would be [[2,2], [3, 1]] . This is because the di�erences in timestamps are (3-1) , (5-3) for the �rst player and

(5-2) , (6-5) for the second player. The �rst value of each list within times_per_player represents the initial starting time for each player.

�� Pair programming? (/~cs61a/su21/articles/pair-programming) We suggest switching roles now, if you haven’t recently. Almost done!

Problem 10 (2 pts)

Implement fastest_words , which returns which words each player typed fastest. This function is called once both players have �nished typing. It takes in a game .

Speci�cally, the fastest_words function returns a list of lists of words, one list for each player, and within each list the words they typed the fastest (against all the other players). In the case of a tie, consider the earliest player in the list (the smallest player index) to be the one who typed it the fastest.

For example consider the following game with the words ‘Just’, ‘have’, and ‘fun’. Player 0 typed ‘fun’ the fastest (3 seconds), Player 1 typed ‘Just’ the fastest (4 seconds), and they tied on the word ‘have’ (both took 1 second) so we consider to Player 0 to be the fastest, because they are the earliest player in the list.

<pre> &gt;&gt;&gt; player_0 = [5, 1, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; player_1 = [4, 1, 6]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; fastest_words(game(['Just', 'have', 'fun'], [player_0, player_1]))
 [['have', 'fun'], ['Just']]
</pre>
The game argument is a game data abstraction, like the one returned in Problem 9. You can access words in the game with the selector word_at , which takes in a game and the word_index (an integer). With word_at you can access the time it took any player to type any word using time .

Be sure to use the accessor functions for the game data abstraction, rather than assuming a particular data format.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.
